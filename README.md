# Shopping list
Literally just a shopping list app, you put the stuff on that you need to buy, you check them off as you throw them in the cart. That's it.
Requests precisely 0 permissions from the user - does not harvest a goldmine of personal data without consent, and most importantly - doesn't transmit anything over the internet.

There's also no ads, because far too many shopping list apps i've used play unskippable 30 second ads after every 3/4 items you put on the list - disgusting!

## Developer Setup

- Clone repo
- Import into Android Studio
- Hope and pray the gradle build works.
